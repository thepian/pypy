There are two sets of tests for lib_pypy:

  - pypy_test contains direct tests for the module in this directory, which
    are supposed to be run by either cpython or pypy (or even jython or
    ironpython, in theory)

  - moreover, there are app-level tests that check how the modules work on
    py.py.  Being app-level, they need to stay somewhere below the main pypy/
    package, so they are in module/test_lib_pypy
